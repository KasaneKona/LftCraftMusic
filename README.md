# LftCraftMusic
I reverse-engineered part of the [Craft demo by Linus Akesson (lft)](https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/index.php) in order to emulate the music and extract the individual channels. I used this to create [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/shlGJkH6ViU). I also created a [swing-tempo version](https://youtu.be/Ujbd7YagcfE) purely because I could ;)
